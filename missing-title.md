# Missing Title (missing-title)

The `title` for a document is required to list it inside the navigation menu. Also fundamentally, a document **cannot exists without a title** in a way **a movie cannot be released without a name**.

## How to fix?
Make sure your document starts with `h1 (#)` or define it inside yaml front matter.

```md
---
title: Document title
---
```

OR

```
# Document title

Here comes the content
```
